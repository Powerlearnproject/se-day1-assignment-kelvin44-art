# SE_Day1
**Software Engineering Day1 Assignment**
**#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering**
**Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.**
Software engineering refers to the systematic application of enginering tools, principles and methods aimed at development of software systems.
some Importance includes:
i. building reliable systems that perform as expected, which is citical for sytems such as healthcare systems.
ii. scalability - ensures that the system integrity is not compromised with increased workload.
iii. security - s/w engineering ensures that there is protection of data in the systems by implementing measures such as authentication.
**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**
  i.development of programming languages such as fontran
  ii. the advent of structured programming in 1960s
  iii. the rise of agile methodologies
**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**
  i.   requirement ananlysis- gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
  ii.  design- involves building the frameworks
  iii. implementation- involves wring the codes and software
  iv.  testing- involves examining the s/w to ensure it meets the function requirements and quality standards
  v.   Deployment- in this stage the software is released to the users and what follows is the maintenance of that system
**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**
waterfall methodology refers to the sequencial approach with distinct phases flowing downward like a waterfall while Agile methodology 
  involves the iteractive and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change
  scenarios
  **waterfall methodologies**
    i. low flexibility
   ii. Testing is done at the end of the development process
 **Agile methodology**
   i. High flexibility
  ii. Testing is done after the end of each iteration
**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team**
i. Software Developer - is tasked with writing the codes and implementing Software solutions 
ii. Quality Assurance engineering- helps to identify the bugs and defects in the code to ensure that the development process results in high quality software products.
iii. Project Manger  - he/she is responsible for overseeing the planning, execution, delivery of software projects

**Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**
IDE - is a software system that provides a platform for the creation of other softwares by enabling, the writing, debugging, and testing of codes. such platforms includes the visual studio, PyCharm.
VCS- it a software for tracking changes to source codes and cordinating work such software includes, GitHub.


**What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**
i. software Security- programmming safe and secure software is very complex and time consuming, cn be resolved through knowledge on ways defend against hacking methods such     as phishing
ii. Time consuming - Software engineering as a career is a time consuming, through the learning and transitioning to work can require a lot of time investment
can be resolved through adopting agile methodologies.

**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance**.
i. Unit Testing - refers to testing the individual components of the software
ii. Integration Testing - refers to testing the interraction between different components
iii. System testing - this is testing th entire System.
iv. Acceptance testing - refers to testing the s/w against user requirements to ensure it meets the users needs.
**#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering**
**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**
Prompt Engineering refers to the process of crafting questions or statements to get the best possible response from AI models
**Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**
Vague prompt: Draw a picture of a dog
Clear prompt: Draw a picture of a brown, labrador breed of dogs, standing next to a lap post during the day, wearing a white collar that says Kimmy.
The additional information such as the breed and the color of the dog and the setting makes it easier for the AI model t come up with a more accurate depiction of our image
